# Groupr

Groupr is a web-app, originally created in the CruzHacks 2019 Hackathon, designed to enable shy students to find groups in college classes. It presents a tinder-like interface to choose the people you do and don't want to work with, and the algorithms do the rest. It is currently (at the time of writing this README) live at groupr.net


### Setup

Groupr requries a Python 3.7 environment to run

Install the dependencies and start the Django server.

```sh
$ cd groupr
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python manage.py runserver
```
 

### Development

As of now, Groupr is more or less finished. It is not fully polished, but it works and we are very happy with the way that it came out. It has been a great learning experience.
